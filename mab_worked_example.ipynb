    "We use a Thompson Sampling Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB TS) to explore solutions to a simple financial game, which I've first encountered in the [Doxod company's Telegram channel](https://t.me/dohod/11500) (in Russian).\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete code for this example is available at https://github.com/agoryuno/mab_ts_example\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules of the game\n",
    "\n",
    "The game is formulated as follows: we have a 1000 shares in 3 traded funds, named \"green\", \"blue\" and \"red\". At the beginning of the game shares in all three funds cost the same, so for simplicity's sake we assume the starting share price to be equal to 1 for all funds. The game is played for 20 rounds and at the end of each round each of the funds' share prices can grow at a rate selected from the following possibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"green\" : {0.8, 0.9, 1.1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.4},\n",
    "    \"blue\"  : {0.95, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.1},\n",
    "    \"red\"   : {0.05, 0.2, 1, 3, 3, 3}\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the growth rate possibilities we can tell that the funds have different expected rates of return and corresponding risks, with the \"red\" fund being the riskiest and having the highest maximum return, and \"blue\" - the least risky with the lowest max return rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Game objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the game is obviously to get the most profit out of our initial investment. To add a bit more realism we'll discount the returns, arbitrarily setting the discount rate to be 0.05. It is needed to note that due to the purely random nature of returns and complete lack of correlations, there's no \"correct solution\" to this game, per se. However, some solutions will be demonstrably better than others \"on average\", therefore our aim is to choose the best general approach out of several options for constructing an investment portfolio given this setting. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note specifically that we are not looking for \"the best\" or \"the optimal\" approach - the algoritm can only choose between the options we propose but can't evolve new options. Keep in mind that this is a classification algorithm at heart.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multi-Armed Bandits\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a lot of information online about Multi-Armed Bandits in general, and Multi-Armed Bandits with Thompson Sampling in particular. Multi-Armed Bandits are essentially a family of classification algorithms, with Thompson Sampling being the Bayesian inference flavor. There's no practical need to use MAB with our game but we'll do it anyway just to explore the algorithm itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The reward function\n",
    "\n",
    "The central part of MAB estimation is the reward function. This is some function which given an action (or an arbitrarily complicated sequence of actions) returns a numeric reward. In probably the most popular practical setting for MAB - modelling user response to ads - this reward is binary, with 1 for clicking on an ad and 0 - ignoring it. In our case it'll be a real number. For the purposes of simplifying sampling we need to keep the scale of the reward fairly tight - the game can generate wildly different returns with maximums exceeding the means by a factor of thousand. Therefore, instead of discounted profit we'll use the natural logarithm of the ratio of the fully discounted value of our portfolio at the end of the game to its starting value (1000 by problem definition) :\n",
    "\n",
    "<table style=\"width:60% \">\n",
    "    <tr><td>$r_a = \\log{ \\frac{v_a}{V (1+d)^T}},$</td> <td>(1)</td></tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "where $V$ - initially invested capital ($V=1000$), $d$ - discount rate ($d=0.05$), $T$ - number of rounds ($T=20$), $v_a$ - value of the portfolio in the end of the game. "

In our case a policy is a specific investment strategy that is followed for the number of periods $T$ and yields value $v_a$ in the end. We'll define a number of such strategies, presented below.\n"

    "### Thompson Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Thompson Sampling\", as [described by Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_sampling), \"consists of choosing the action that maximizes the expected reward with respect to a randomly drawn belief\". What that means in plain English is that when faced with a choice between two or more options (\"Arms\" in our context) we choose that which we *believe* will yield the highest reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being more concrete, our *belief* in an Arm's reward is described by a certain distribution of the values of reward, specified by selected values for the given distribution's parameters. In other words, before starting to repeatedly play a Bandit, we choose a distribution function which - in our *belief* - more or less accurately describes how the true (produced by the \"world\") values of the Arms' rewards are distributed. We then choose (usually heuristically) the starting values for the distributions' parameters, and then sample a random value from the distribution for each Arm and pull the Arm which receives the highest number.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the game progresses, and for each pull of an Arm we receive an actual reward, in a perfectly Bayesian spirit we update the values of the distributions' parameters (for each Arm separately - each Arm maintains its own set of parameters). That process of repeated updates to the initial *belief* results in the distributions \"narrowing\" down towards the true mean rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the distribution for each Arm \"narrows\", both extremely small and extremely large values become increasingly *less likely* to be drawn, and that (specifically the decreasing likelihood of drawing extremely large values) decreases the probability of an Arm being chosen if the mean of its distribution is smaller than that of the other Arms. Therefore, the Arm that has the highest mean becomes *more likely* to be drawn as the game progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if some Arm (pun intended) is picked more rarely than others - its distribution will remain \"wider\" than the rest, thus the probability of drawing an extremely large value for that Arm is relatively higher, which increases its chances of being chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "That mechanism of counter-acting probabilities is how Thompson Sampling solves the \"explore-exploit\" dilemma that is central to all types of reinforcement learning: it focuses on using (exploiting) the Arm with the highest expected mean reward but leaves space for the other Arms to be chosen every once in a while (exploring).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updating an Arm\n",
    "\n",
    "The `update()` method of the `Arm` class is then key to making Thompson Sampling work. To implement this method we first need to choose the distribution that we *believe* more or less accurately represents how the actual rewards are distributed. However, our choice needs to be guided by expedience alongside with accuracy. By this I mean that whatever distribution we choose for our likelihood function, which tells us how likely a certain reward is given the distribution's parameters, it must have a readily available \"conjugate\" prior distribution, which tells us how likely the parameter values are before the actual rewards are factored in.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the parameters of the likelihood function's distribution are sampled from the prior distribution and the hypotetical reward is then sampled from the likelihood function's distribution with the sampled parameters. The importance of the two distribution's being \"conjugate\" lies in the fact that update equations of parameters of such a pair of distributions can be derived algebraically, making the update process fast and simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's more, people have already found solutions for quite a few pairs of conjugate distributions and Wikipedia offers a comprehensive [table of the most commonly used combinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior#Table_of_conjugate_distributions).\n",
    "\n",
    "For our problem we'll use the Normal-NormalGamma pair of distributions. Although, since we are using log-reward, as opposed to straight reward, it is actually LogNormal-NormalGamma.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will sample our rewards from the normal distribution with parameters $\\mu$ and $\\frac{1} {\\lambda \\tau}$, with $\\tau$ being sampled from the gamma distribution with parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The update equation for $\\mu$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu' = \\frac {\\lambda  \\mu + n  \\bar {x}} {\\lambda + n}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu'$ is the updated value of $\\mu$, $n$ - the number of samples we've already taken (equiv. the number of times the Arm's been played), $\\bar {x}$ - the mean of the actual rewards received.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $\\beta$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\beta' = \\beta + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2} + \\frac {n \\lambda} {\\lambda + n} \\frac {(\\bar{x} - \\mu)^2} {2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\beta'$ is the updated value of $\\beta$, $x_i$ is an i-th factual reward value.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the update equations for $\\alpha$ and $\\lambda$ are much simpler:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\alpha' = \\alpha + \\frac {n}{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\lambda' = \\lambda + n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha'$ and $\\lambda'$ are the updated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these equations we can proceed to construct the practical implementation of an Arm. Once again we begin with the `__init__()` method."
